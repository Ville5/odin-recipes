    <h1>Thai green curry</h1>
    <img src="https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Thai-Green-Curry-square-FS.jpg" alt="thai green curry with bright colors">
    <p>Our 9-year-old is a big fan of Thai green curry. When he was younger, he used to 
        call it 'that browny coloured curry'. Mmmm appetizing!
        It's true though - most Thai green curry pastes are a kind of sludgy brown 
        colour.</p>
    <p>We used to buy a green (brown) curry paste that was relatively mild. I 
        think it was the one made by Thai Taste. But in the last couple of years I've 
        noticed it's become spicier. And despite my efforts to find a new mild green 
        curry paste, I've constantly found they're spicy enough that the kids need a 
        pint glass of water to manage their dinner!</p>
    <p>So now I'll often make my own <a href="https://www.kitchensanctuary.com/skinny-thai-green-curry-paste/"> Thai green curry paste</a></p>

        <li>Start by making the curry paste. To a high powered blender, add the 
            green chillies, spring onions, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, kaffir 
            limes leaves, zest and juice of 1 lime, salt, white pepper, cumin, ground 
            coriander, shrimp paste and fish sauce. Pulse until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Add the large bunch of fresh coriander (stalks too) and pulse again 
            until smooth. You might need to scrape down the sides a couple of times 
            to ensure it's fully combined. Put to one side.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan (skillet) over a medium-high heat. 
            Add the chicken and fry for 5-6 minutes until just cooked through. Add 
            the curry pasta you made earlier - you need about 4 heaped tbsp. Stir 
            and cook through for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle on the stock cube, stir and pour in the coconut milk. Heat 
            through until the coconut milk is very hot but not boiling.</li>
        <li>Add in the broccoli, sugarsnap peas (snow peas) and bamboo shoots and 
            stir together. Heat through for a few more minute, stirring often until 
            the vegetables are lightly cooked, but still crisp.</li>
        <li>Stir in the sugar.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice topped with Thai basil and freshly chopped red chillies.</li>
