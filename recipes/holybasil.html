    <p> In said recipes, we used what our local Asian grocery store labels as, 
        “Thai Basil,” which is actually a variety of cinnamon basil. This is also the 
        kind of basil most commonly used in Thai restaurants here in the States, I 
        believe.</p>
    <p>That said, a few commenters on those recipes felt very passionately about 
        our basil usage, suggesting—demanding—that we use holy basil in our 
        recipes. The translation of “Pad Kra Pao,” is apparently “holy basil 
        stir-fry,” so you can’t (technically) make the dish without this key 
        ingredient.</p>

        <li>In a wok over medium high heat, add the oil, shallots and garlic, and 
            fry for 3 minutes. Add the chilies and cook for another minute. Crank
             up the heat to high, and add the ground pork, breaking it up into small 
             bits and allowing it to crisp up.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and oyster sauce. 
            Stir-fry for another minute and deglaze the pan with the broth or water. 
            Because your pan is over high heat, the liquid should cook off very quickly. 
            Add the basil, and stir-fry until wilted. Serve over rice.</li>
