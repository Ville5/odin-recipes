    <p>This Instant Pot Panang Curry recipe tastes like it’s from a Thai restaurant!  
        Creamy coconut milk, Panang curry paste, chicken, vegetables, and spices come 
        together to make an amazingly tasty curry that is delicious served with jasmine rice.  
        It’s a quick and easy recipe that you can make on a weeknight but it’s impressive 
        enough to serve guests!</p>
        <p>The key to getting the Panang curry recipe right was to add an extra quantity of 
            the ingredients that make it different from the red curry: coriander, cumin, and 
            peanuts.  I feel these flavors were lacking because pressure cooking toned down 
            those flavors and made it seem like they weren’t even present.</p>
